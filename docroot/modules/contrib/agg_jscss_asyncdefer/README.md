## INTRODUCTION

This module allows you to load JS and CSS files with async or defer attributes for selected libraries or force all JS and CSS files to use a specific attribute. If the files are compressed, it creates different compressed files based on the attribute.

Through a configuration form located at Configuration > Development > Performance, you can choose to force all JS or CSS files to use a specific attribute or select individual libraries to apply the attribute.

## INSTALLATION
