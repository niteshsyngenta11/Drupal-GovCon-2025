# Sponsor Listing

The **Sponsor Listing** component displays a structured list of sponsors, each represented by a logo with a link to their website.

## Usage

This component is primarily used in **partnership sections** to showcase sponsor logos in a structured format. It dynamically renders a list of sponsors, supporting the following variables:

### Variables

- **`sponsor_heading`**: Sets the heading for the sponsor section. Rendered as an `<h2>` if defined.
- **`sponsors`**: An array containing sponsor details, including:
  - `logo_url`: The URL of the sponsorâ€™s logo image.
  - `logo_alt`: Alternative text for the logo (defaults to `"Sponsor Logo"`).
  - `link`: External or internal link associated with the sponsor (defaults to `"#"` if not provided).
